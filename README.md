# Chatbot-Model---Academic-Project

Zero coding learning is an online platform which provides a wide variety of machine learning models to 
explore without the need for coding by users. Presently the company supports users on the platform with 
email support and is not scalable. The proposal is to develop chatbots to provide a quick resolution to the 
customer and direct to customer service for unanswered questions. This project's scope is to develop an 
AI+NLP-based chatbot for proof of concept (POC). The delivered POC is based on BERT based Question 
Answering Model which uses dynamic model selection approach to choose best output from traditional 
BERT QA Model + pattern matching module and hugging face BERT QA Model pipeline. The 
performance of the model is measured using ROUGE approach and the model delivered accuracy of 91%
and average response time of 33 seconds in personal laptop configuration.
